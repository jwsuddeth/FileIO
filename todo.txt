File input and output notes:

Sequential Access example

Direct Access Example



Creating a File – See pseudocode for examples creating a .dat file and variable in the code

Pseudocode example writing a file

C++ example writing a file


Example opening input file with append mode 


Processing Files:

Using a loop to process files:
	Example creating a sales file pseudocode
	Example reading and displaying a sales file with while loop while file.good()


Processing Records:
 Show their pseudocode example using a record with name, ID, department

Show C++ example with ID, name, expense, expense type


Control-Break Logic:

Assume we have Store Number, State, Sales in a file. File is ordered by State.
We want to produce a sales report that shows the total sales for each state.

C++ Examples Needed:

Open a file for writing and write a line of text.
Open a file for writing in append mode and write a line of text.
Open a file for writing and write some binary data

Open a file for reading and read a line of text
Open a file for reading and read the entire file
Open a file for binary reading and read the binary data


Define a struct for structured data and use it to write data
Use the struct to read the data back out
show how to use direct access to access a record

Control break logic – Produce an expense report
